## Preliminary Hydrologic Anomaly Notification Script
Current USGS Water Alerts do not handle condition logic, such as
nofictication of stage increase in the absense of preciptation at
nearby gages.  This is an initial crack at setting up R scripts to
generate an email alert when an anomalous stage increase occurs.  This
could help to identify illicit discharges.

### alertScript.r
This script does two NWIS pulls for stage and precipitation,
respectivley. Resutls are then subset to the past hour of flow, and
past two hours of precipitation.  Finally, if a given stage change is
detected AND only a minimum of precip is observed, an email alert is sent.

### alertScheduler.r
This script schedules the alertScript.  As currently configured, it
will run every 5 minutes.  The final call to taskscheduler_delete is
needed to remove the task from the Windows task schedule.
